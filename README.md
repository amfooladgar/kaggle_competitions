# Kaggle Competitions Repository

This repository contains my work on various Kaggle competitions, showcasing different machine learning approaches and techniques for solving real-world data science problems.

## 📊 Active Competitions

## Previous Competitions

### [Predict Future Sales](./Predict%20Sale%20Comp/)
**Competition:** [Competitive Data Science: Predict Future Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales)

Final project for the "How to win a data science competition" Coursera course. The goal is to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month using historical sales data from a Russian software company.

**Key Techniques:**
- Time series forecasting
- Feature engineering with lag features
- XGBoost regression
- LSTM neural networks
- Monthly and daily aggregation strategies

**Status:** Multiple submissions with iterative improvements
